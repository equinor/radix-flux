    ## Azure Best Practice:
    # We strongly recommend including entire groups such as dbformysql.azure.com/* in crdPattern.
    # Individual CRDs such as dbformysql.azure.com/FlexibleServer may be specified as well, but there are often other
    # resources in the group which pair together to enable other scenarios, such as dbformysql.azure.com/FlexibleServersFirewallRules.
    # Itâ€™s generally easier to just include the whole group.

    crdPattern: 'network.azure.com/*'
